## Pewlett-Hackard Employee Retirement Forecasting and Future Personnel Planning in SQL with pgAdmin

## PURPOSE
To determine the number of retiring employees per title (Senior Engineer, Senior Staff,…)  and identify the employees that met the criteria for a mentorship program, using SQL in pgAdmin.

## RESULTS
- There are about 72,500 employees at Pewlett-Hackard that are eligible for retirement, and approximately 50,000 are of a senior position. This is about 30% of the company as a whole and almost 50% of the senior positions respectively.

### Retirement Eligible

- Specifically for the Senior Engineer position about 93% of current employees are eligible for retirement

- For some of the mid level positions such as Engineer or Staff. The retirement eligible employees make up a much smaller proportion, about 10%.

- The employees that met the criteria for Pewlett-Hackard’s mentorship program constituted of about 1549 employees, less than 1% of the company.

## SUMMARY
As the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact, Pewlett-Hackard will have to build a robust hiring team and keep the retention rate very high.  Further analysis on existing salaries compared to salaries of the market could draw more employees and further retain existing senior employees.

It would also be worth further analysis to see the age distribution of the current active employees and expanding the age criteria for the mentorship program. The potential mentors vastly outnumber the current number of employees that meet the mentorship criteria.
